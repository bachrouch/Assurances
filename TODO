## urgent

* check dates on quote (no more events on model since they are shared between
  consult and modify views)
* add a security level on services (no update on contract)

## views

* check .tkf-XXX usage

  * .tkf-stepx-yyy for processes

* check when and why using setTimeout (declaring events)
* generalize initEvents and initListeners on forms
* avoid cb in data select forms (probably requests)

## pages

* manage templates by code (no need to list via xxx-templates

## refactoring

* avoid using contract word (use policy)
* avoid using quote concept (policy is the object, quote is a state,
  contract is a state)
* all messages should be in a dedicated file (msg.js per module)
* grep setTimeout and explain all cases
* mod.controller should be forbidden (it is a super layer, not visible
  from models/views)
